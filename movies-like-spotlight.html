So,&nbsp;here’s the list of best movies similar to ‘Spotlight’ that are our recommendations.

The movie is based on a book written by Kathryn Stockett. It is set in the year 1960, in the state of Mississippi, where African-Americans were severely mistreated in white households. The protagonist, played by Emma Stone, is a freshly graduated writer who returns to her hometown, Jackson. She decides to fight for the cause of the Blacks. She makes an unprecedented move by questioning her own race of their unfair ways. She interviews black women who work at homes of the affluent white folks in the city. The movie beautifully depicts the nuances of those who suffer from the wrath of societal conditioning.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>11. The Post (2017)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=141723 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/movies-like-spotlight/5a1c9b8e3863d/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/5a1c9b8e3863d.jpg data-orig-size=750,500 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"1"}' data-image-title=5a1c9b8e3863d data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/5a1c9b8e3863d.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/5a1c9b8e3863d.jpg?w=750" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/_d_improd_/5a1c9b8e3863d_f_improf_833x555.jpg alt width=833 height=555 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Similar to Spotlight’s investigative journalism, ‘The Post’ is a gripping movie which focuses on freedom of the press while simultaneously highlighting aspects of feminism. It is based on the challenging <a href=#>US-Vietnam war</a> and the rising power of the government that tried to hide the truth. The Washington Post’s new owner Mrs. Graham played by the legendary actress, <a href=#>Meryl Streep</a>, is given the responsibility to uphold the nation’s civil liberties. Joining hands with a determined Ben Bagdikian, assistant editor of The Post, played by Tom Hanks, they form a small rebellion and start investigating facts of the secretive Nixon government. Mrs. Graham’s role also showcases strength and maturity in a male-dominated world in spite of being constantly undermined by her male cohorts for her lack of journalistic experience. An electrifying drama and a power packed performance by Streep and Hanks, ‘The Post’ is a must watch.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>10.

Corruption amongst politicians allows a minister’s son to get away with the murder of a young woman who refuses to offer him alcohol at a bar only because it was past the closing time. The victim’s sister (Vidya Balan) fights for several years to get justice for Jessica but due to tampering of court evidence and paid-off witnesses, she loses the case. Rani Mukherjee is made aware of this issue and she uses the power of journalism to reopen the case. A gripping movie based on a true account of the Jessica Lal case, 1999, ‘No One Killed Jessica’ is an exciting watch.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>8. V for Vendetta (2005)</h4><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=51772 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/movies-like-divergent/v-for-vendetta-2/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/v-for-vendetta.jpg data-orig-size=916,600 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="v for vendetta" data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/v-for-vendetta.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/v-for-vendetta.jpg?w=916" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/_d_improd_/v-for-vendetta-1024x671_f_improf_843x553.jpg alt width=843 height=553 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>At the time of its release, ‘<a href=#>V for Vendetta</a>‘ was hailed for its stunning visuals as well as amazing script: a potent combination that marks for a great movie. The film is a set in 2032 in a <a href=#>dystopian</a> world, where the British are ruled by a totalitarian government. To combat the unjust government, a man wearing a mask, popularly identified as ‘V’ (played by Hugo Weaving), uses his skilled art of martial techniques to fight crimes in Britain. He is supported in bringing down the government by his accomplice Evey, who he had once saved from getting attacked by power hungry policemen. Evey is played by the very talented Natalie Portman. A grim and a clever take on the issue of fascism, ‘V for Vendetta’ is arguably one of the greatest thriller movies ever made. This is one of those few excellent action packed movies with captivating dialogues.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>7.

A fantastic job done by Sandra Bullock and Kevin Spacey, this classic movie keeps up its intensity till the end. An encapsulating movie, ‘A Time to Kill’ highlights the relationship between justice and human existence.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>6.

An ex-filtration specialist goes on a mission to rescue six American hostages stuck in Iran during the Iranian revolution. The CIA specialist played by Ben Affleck himself teams up with an ex-CIA-turned-Hollywood makeup artist (played by Alan Arkin) to come up with a fake movie and a well-invented script, which is based in Iran. Affleck’s role in the movie flies to Tehran in order to teach the Americans hiding in the Canadian Embassy to act as crew members of the phony movie and somehow get them aboard an aircraft. A nail-biting thriller, Ben Affleck’s subtle performance in a tumultuous environment leaves the audience jittery and glued to the cinema screen.</p><h4 style=text-align:center>5.

The film was a commercial success and also received high praise from critics. The film portrays the life of an unemployed, single mother of three children who fights a multi-billion-dollar energy corporation that got away with polluting the groundwater of Hinkley, California for a long time. What makes this movie so endearing is the way Erin manages to juggle her family life and goes against all odds to discover the truth. This movie brings to light the zealous and fearless nature of a woman who serves as an inspiration to all those who come across her story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwqrrEppihp5yesG%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0ecuiop5lo6W8tbjIoJ%2BtZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./celebrities-neon-eyeshadow-bright-makeup-pics-3388695.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>13 Celebs Rocking Neon Eyeshadow Like Pros: Priyanka Chopra &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jolie-jones-levine.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Jolie Jones Levines Husband, Any Children Together?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ha-young-choi.html>Ha Young Choi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./johnny-depp-clean-shaven-makeover-nyc-before-after-photos.html>Before &amp;amp; After Pics Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittany-renner-viral-video-scandal-telegram.html>Brittany Renner Viral Video Leaked Footage Scandal On Telegram 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-2.html>Patrick Mahomes Age, Net Worth, Wife, Family &amp;amp; Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suzanne-somers-74-dishes-she-and-husband-alan-hamel-84-have-been-having-a-lot-of-sex.html>Suzanne Somers, 74, dishes she and husband Alan Hamel, 84, have been 'having a lot of sex'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy.
