snowmobiles, and no skis<br>Mad at me ’cause I can finally afford<br>To provide my family with groceries</p><p>Got a crib with a studio and it’s all full of tracks<br>To add to the wall, full of plaques<br>Hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies<br>Did y’all think I’ma let my dough freeze, hoe please<br>You better bow down on both knees<br>Who you think taught you to smoke trees?<br>Who you think brought you the oldies?<br>Eazy-E’s, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C’s<br>The Snoop D-O-double-G’s<br>And the group that said, “Motherfuck the police”</p><p>Gave you a tape full of dope beats<br>To bump when you stroll through in your hood<br>And when your album sales wasn’t doing too good<br>Who’s the Doctor they told you to go see?<br>Y’all better listen up closely<br>All you

way<br>Then just study a tape of N.W.A<br>One day, I was walking by<br>With a Walkman on<br>When I caught a guy<br>Give me an awkward eye<br>And I strangled him up in the parking lot<br>With his Karl Kani</p><p>I don’t give a fuck if it’s dark or not<br>I’m harder than me tryna park a Dodge<br>When I’m drunk as fuck<br>Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage<br>Hopping out with two broken legs<br>Trying to walk it off<br>Fuck you too bitch, call the cops<br>I’ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfucking barking dogs</p><p>And when the cops came through<br>Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house<br>With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches<br>And still weren’t found out<br>From here on out it’s the Chronic II<br>Starting today and tomorrow’s anew<br>And I’m still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew</p><p>Slim Shady, hotter then a set of twin babies<br>In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up<br>When the temp goes up to the mid-80s<br>Calling men ladies, sorry, Doc, but I been crazy<br>There’s no way that you can save me<br>It’s okay, go with him Hailie</p><p>Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say<br>But nothing comes

hands out looking up to me<br>Like you want something free<br>When my last CD was out<br>You wasn’t bumping me<br>But now that I got this little company<br>Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease<br>But you won’t get a crumb from me<br>‘Cause I’m from the streets of Compton</p><p>I told ’em all, all them little gangstas<br>Who you think helped mold ’em all?<br>Now you wanna run around talking ’bout guns<br>Like I ain’t got none<br>What you think I sold ’em all?<br>‘Cause I stay well off<br>Now all I get is hate mail all day<br>Saying, “Dre fell off”?<br>What? ‘Cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad<br>Tryin’ to get this damn label off</p><p>I ain’t havin’ that, this is the millennium of Aftermath<br>It ain’t gonna be nothin’ after that<br>So give me one more platinum
