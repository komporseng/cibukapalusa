He served as an outfielder and third baseman in American Major League Baseball (MLB), having played for eight MLB teams including the San Diego Padres, Los Angeles Dodgers, and New York Mets. His professional playing career spanned from 1988 to 2009, and he has since transitioned into the role of a sports agent.</p><p>Given his remarkable career, one might wonder about Gary Sheffield’s wealth as of mid-2016. Sources estimate his net worth at an impressive $90 million, largely stemming from his successful tenure as a professional baseball player. Moreover, his transition into sports agency work further contributed to his net worth.</p><h3>Accomplishments and Growth of Net Worth</h3><p>Gary Sheffield was brought up in Belmont Heights by a single mother, where he, along with his uncle Dwight Gooden, began developing his baseball skills. At the age of 11, he joined the Belmont Heights Little League team, later moving on to join Hillsborough High School where he excelled as a third baseman and pitcher. Following his graduation, he was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 1986 MLB draft. His career took off from there, and his net worth began to grow steadily.</p><p>Signing contracts with the Milwaukee Brewers kick-started the increase in his net worth, and as he moved through various MLB teams, his wealth continued to grow. Notable highlights of his career include playing for the Florida Marlins and the Los Angeles Dodgers, where he achieved significant success and also participated in multiple All-Star games.</p><p>His move to the Atlanta Braves and later the New York Yankees, with a substantial contract worth $39 million over three years, further bolstered his net worth. Despite facing injuries and team transfers, he continued to shine, evidenced by his 500th home run while playing for the New York Mets. Retiring from active play, he delved into the world of sports management, contributing significantly to his overall net worth.</p><p>On the personal front, Gary Sheffield is a father to seven children from various relationships and has been married to DeLeon Richards since 2000. The family resides in Tampa, Florida.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Facts</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Gary Sheffield</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$90 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 18, 1968</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Tampa, Florida, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.8 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>86 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Sports agent</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Hillsborough High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Deleon Richards (m. 2000)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Noah Sheffield, Gary Sheffield Jr., Garret Sheffield,Christian Sheffield, Jaden Sheffield, Carissa Sheffield, Ebony Sheffield</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Betty Jones</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://twitter.com/garysheffield</a></td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1246566/</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Best Breakthrough Athlete ESPY Award</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Home Run Showdown</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=interesting_facts><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>(1 April) Released by the Detroit Tigers.
