In the sixth episode, titled ‘<a href=#>One Ocean Closer to Destiny</a>,’ Hank instructs Teonna to cut her hair and burn her clothes. They change teonna’s appearance to make her look like a boy and dress her in the clothes of Hank’s son. While Hank burns down most of Teonna’s belongings to prevent her from getting caught, he refuses to bury her Bible fearing retribution from God. Instead, Teonna buries the Bible in a hole at a nearby creek. Hank promises to send a word for Teonna’s father while he continues on his journey and protecting Teonna. However, the seventh episode sees Teonna and Hank running into trouble as the Priests, who are sent to retrieve Teonna, catch up with them.</p><h2>Is Hank Dead?</h2><p>In the seventh episode, titled ‘The Rule of Five Hundred,’ Hank sends his son, Pete, to talk with Teonna’s father. Pete informs Runs His Horse about his daughter’s situation but gets caught by the Priests. Eventually, two of the Priests find Teonna but are initially confused by her appearance as a boy. However, the disguise does not last long, as the Priests recognize Teonna. They try to rag Teonna back to the Catholic School forcefully. However, Hank intervenes and saves Teonna from a grim fate.</p><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=675987 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/why-was-banner-arrested-in-1923-will-he-get-the-death-penalty/ys1923_unit_105_102122_cs_00051_rt_rt-2/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/YS1923_UNIT_105_102122_CS_00051_RT_RT-2.jpg data-orig-size=1200,600 data-comments-opened=0 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="YS1923_UNIT_105_102122_CS_00051_RT_RT (2)" data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/YS1923_UNIT_105_102122_CS_00051_RT_RT-2.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/YS1923_UNIT_105_102122_CS_00051_RT_RT-2.jpg?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/YS1923_UNIT_105_102122_CS_00051_RT_RT-2.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Hank shoots the Priests with his shotgun and seemingly kills them. However, one of the Priests survives. Hank lets down his gun to carry Teonna, who is injured during the conflict. As a result, the Priests use the gun to shoot Hank. As a result, Hank dies while trying to protect Teonna. Hank’s character concludes with his death as he keeps his word to Teonna until his last breath. Moreover, he also paves the way for Teonna to reunite with her father before his death. Nonetheless, Hank’s death is untimely and comes as a major surprise for the viewers. With his character’s death, it is safe to say that actor Michael Greyeyes’ time on the show has ended.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwqrrEppihp5yesG%2BvzqZmsKCRqXqprc%2BpnKerXam8brTAp6JmoZ5ifnp%2BkmagrGWYmnqlscCdZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alona-tal.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alona Tal Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marian-lopez-fernandez-cao.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Marian Lopez Fernandez-Cao</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ha-young-choi.html>Ha Young Choi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./johnny-depp-clean-shaven-makeover-nyc-before-after-photos.html>Before &amp;amp; After Pics Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittany-renner-viral-video-scandal-telegram.html>Brittany Renner Viral Video Leaked Footage Scandal On Telegram 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-2.html>Patrick Mahomes Age, Net Worth, Wife, Family &amp;amp; Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suzanne-somers-74-dishes-she-and-husband-alan-hamel-84-have-been-having-a-lot-of-sex.html>Suzanne Somers, 74, dishes she and husband Alan Hamel, 84, have been 'having a lot of sex'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy.
