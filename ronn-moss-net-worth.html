He is best known as a member of Player rock band, as well as for his role of Ridge Forrester in CBS’ TV soap opera “The Bold and the Beautiful”.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how much wealth this multi-talented man has accumulated so far? How rich Ronn Moss is? According to sources, it is estimated that the total of Ronn Moss’ net worth, as of early 2017, exceeds the sum of $12 million, acquired through his career in the entertainment industry which has been active since 1969.</p><h3>Ronn Moss Net Worth $12 million</h3><p>Growing up in the world’s capital of the entertainment industry, Los Angeles, Ronn was surrounded by music and theater from his very early years. At the age of 11, he began learning to play guitar as well as drums, and later founded his own band and circulated LA’s club scene, even though he was still too young to even enter the clubs. He is an alumni of the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA).</p><p>In 1976, Ronn alongside several friends, in a garage in Hollywood Hills formed the rock band entitled Player. The band’s original line up consisted of Ronn as a bassist and singer, John Friesen on drums, John Charles Crowley on keyboards and Peter Beckett as a singer and guitarist. In 1977, Player released their eponymous debut studio album which was subsequently followed by “Danger Zone” released in 1978, and featured the hit single “Baby Come Back” which peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard pop charts. This initial success provided the basis for Ronn Moss’ current respectable net worth.</p><p>As an actor, Ronn debuted in the role of Saracen hero Ruggero in the 1983 Italian historical adventure movie “I Paladini – Storia d’Armi e d’Amori” (“Hearts and Armour”), while in 1987 he played a notable role in Andy Sidaris’ action thriller “Hard Ticket to Hawaii”. However, the real breakthrough in Ronn Moss’ acting career occurred later in 1987, when he was cast for the role of the fashion magnate Ridge Forrester in te TV soap opera “The Bold and Beautiful”. The show aired for over two and a half decades ‘til 2012, during which Ronn starred in 3,226 episodes. Certainly the latter engagement helped Ronn Moss to gain huge popularity with audiences, as well as dramatically increasing his wealth.</p><p>Additionally, other memorable Ronn Moss’ acting performances include the voice acting role of Dr. Forrester in the 2008 animated comedy “Bolt”, as well as appearances in popular TV series such as “Familie”, “Bruna in Beverly Hills” and more recently in the Emmy Award-winning drama series “The Bay” in which serves as the producer and also portrays John Blackwell. Between 2012 and 2013, Ronn Moss directed, produced and hosted his own talk-show “Ronn’s Garage”. Doubtlessly, all these accomplishments have helped Ronn Moss to boost his net worth.</p><p>Despite still being the member of Player, Ronn Moss also made some efforts towards his solo career – in 2006 he released his solo studio album “Uncovered” which was particularly popular in Australia. Ronn has also appeared in the Italian version of popular TV reality show “Dancing with the Stars” as well as in “Celebrity Wife Swap”.</p><p>When it comes to his personal life, Ronn Moss has married twice. Between 1990 and 2002 he was married to colleague, actress and a producer Shari Shattuck with whom he has two children. Since 2009, Ronn has been married to Devin DeVasquez who is also an actress and a producer.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table class=interesting_facts readability=7.5590551181102><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=1.2105263157895><td>1</td><td>Ex-brother-in-law of <a href=#>Shawna Shattuck</a>.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>He wrote a song for his two daughters.
