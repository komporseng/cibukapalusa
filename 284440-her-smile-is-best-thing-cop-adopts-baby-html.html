People in uniforms are often misunderstood for being rude, unfair, and uncooperative. But a California police officer's kind act proves otherwise.</p><p class=Zg>Officer Jesse Whitten from the Santa Rosa Police Department never thought that a <strong class=Xg>chance encounter with a homeless woman</strong> would change his life forever.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>[Left] Ashleigh and Jesse Whitten with their kids.

He <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/human-interest/jesse-whitten-adopt-homeless-baby-felt-right/>told</a> PEOPLE:</p><p class=Zg>â€œShe was very honest about her situation, how she was struggling with drug addiction and what was going on in her life."</p><p class=Zg>Jesse often checked up on her as a benevolent man and offered to take her to a shelter.

Because she was homeless and the baby had drugs in her system, the county asked her if she wished to arrange for emergency placement in foster care.</p><p class=Zg>Instead, she told them to call Officer Jesse.
