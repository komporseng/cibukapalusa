People in uniforms are often misunderstood for being rude, unfair, and uncooperative. But a California police officer's kind act proves otherwise.</p><p class=Zg>Officer Jesse Whitten from the Santa Rosa Police Department never thought that a <strong class=Xg>chance encounter with a homeless woman</strong> would change his life forever.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>[Left] Ashleigh and Jesse Whitten with their kids.

Amongst them was <strong class=Xg>a woman he met on patrol in 2017, </strong>who was going through a rough patch in her life. He <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/human-interest/jesse-whitten-adopt-homeless-baby-felt-right/>told</a> PEOPLE:</p><p class=Zg>“She was very honest about her situation, how she was struggling with drug addiction and what was going on in her life."</p><p class=Zg>Jesse often checked up on her as a benevolent man and offered to take her to a shelter.

Jesse didn't know how serious she was until she delivered the baby on February 9, 2018.</p><p class=Zg>Despite trying to stay clean, the woman's baby girl was born with heroin traces in her system. Because she was homeless and the baby had drugs in her system, the county asked her if she wished to arrange for emergency placement in foster care.</p><p class=Zg>Instead, she told them to call Officer Jesse. So on Valentine's Day in 2018, the Whittens received a call that said <strong class=Xg>the biological mom specifically wanted them to adopt her baby.</strong></p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Ashley and Jesse Whitten with their adoptive daughter, Harlow Maisey Whitten. | Photo: YouTube.com/Good Morning America</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>WELCOMING AN ANGEL</strong></p><p class=Zg>Ashley shared that the woman had envisioned a perfect life for her child, but she couldn't give it to her because of her condition.
