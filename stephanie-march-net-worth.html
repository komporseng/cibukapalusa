Stephanie is an actress best known for portraying Alexandra Cabot in the long-running series,“Law & Order: Special Victims Unit”. She’s also made appearances in films and television shows like “Mr. & Mrs. Smith”, and “30 Rock”. Her acting performances have raised her net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Stephanie March? Sources tell us of her net worth that is at $10 million as of early 2016, mostly earned through a successful acting career on television and in film. She’s also had a bit of success on the stage in various theatre productions. As her career continues, it is expected that her wealth will also steadily increase.</p><h3>Stephanie March Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>March discovered her passion for acting in high school, where she began performing in stage plays at Highland Park High School, a school also attended by <a href=#>Angie Harmon</a> from “Law & Order”. She graduated from Northwestern University with a degree in Theater & Hispanic Studies in 1996. While studying, she played the character Helena in Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”, and immediately afterwards in 1997, she found an opportunity to act on television in the CBS series “Early Edition”. Two years later, she moved to New York and started a Broadway career, in popular plays like “Death of a Salesman”, “Talk Radio”, and “Boy’s Life”. This was the real start of her net worth.</p><p>In the year 2000, she was cast to play the Assistant District Attorney Cabot in TV’s “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit”. She went on to become a main cast member, and then a recurring cast member until 2003. I that year, she made her film debut in “Head of State” alongside <a href=#>Chris Rock</a>. She also made a film with <a href=#>Ricky Gervais</a> – “The Invention of Lying”. On television, she had guest appearances in series like “Grey’s Anatomy”, “Rescue Me”, and “Happy Endings”.</p><p>Aside from acting, Stephanie also finds herself busy with numerous philanthropic works. She became an ambassador to the World of Children Awards during 2010, and became a board member for Safe Horizon, which focuses on helping victims of abuse and crime. Other than that, March has mentioned that she is an advocate for women’s rights and is a supporter of Planned Parenthood.</p><p>In her personal life, Stephanie was married to celebrity chef <a href=#>Bobby Flay</a> from 2005 to 2015. During this time, she made appearances in <a href=#>Bobby’s</a> shows like “Boy Meets Grill” and “Throwdown with Bobby Flay”. Their divorce was finalized in early-2015 and it was suspected that Bobby was involved with a third party which ended the relationship; in fact many tabloids alleged that Bobby was meeting with other women during the course of their marriage. While the former couple has stated that they’d rather keep most of the details secret, according to some sources the couple may have split <a href=#>Bobby Flay’s</a> net worth as a result of the divorce. If that was the case then Stephanie may have increased her net worth even further.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=10.627596439169><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Stephanie March</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 23, 1974</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Dallas, Texas, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.77&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor,</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Northwestern University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Bobby Flay (m. 2005 - 2015)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Sophie Flay</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>John Abe March IV, Laura Len</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Charlotte March</td></tr><tr readability=0.22857142857143><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Stephanie-March/183358158398627</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34146341463415><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/marchstephanie</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0545335</a></td></tr><tr readability=12><td>Movies</td><td>Head of State, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Jesse Stone: Night Passage, Flannel Pajamas, The Treatment, Falling for Grace, The Invention of Lying, Why Stop Now, Innocence, Death of a Salesman</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>TV Shows</td><td>Conviction, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=7><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=6><td>1</td><td>I am thrilled to support World of Children and its superlative efforts to fund changemakers around the world.
