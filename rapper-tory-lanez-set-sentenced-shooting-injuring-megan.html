The request for a new trial was denied in May.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Jose Baez, Lanez's attorney, told reporters outside the courtroom on Tuesday afternoon that the sentence was "extreme" and the rapper's legal team plans to appeal.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Tory did not get the sentence that we had certainly hoped for," Baez said. "I think the sentence that was handed down was incredibly harsh."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"This is another example of someone being punished for their celebrity status and someone being utilized as a -- to send an example and he's not an example he's a human being," Baez added. "I think it's incredibly unfortunate, and it's something that we plan on appealing."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Baez said that Lanez is feeling "down" and "sad" thinking about the time he will miss with his son while he serves his sentence.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón, whose officer prosecuted this case, said in a statement on Tuesday after the sentencing that "this case highlighted the numerous ways that our society must do better for women."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">“Over the past three years, Mr. Peterson has engaged in a pattern of conduct that was intended to intimidate Ms. Pete and silence her truths from being heard,” Gascón said. “Women, especially Black women, are afraid to report crimes like assault because they are too often not believed. I commend Megan Pete for her incredible bravery and vulnerability as she underwent months of probing investigation and court appearances where she had to relive her trauma, and the public scrutiny that followed."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The defense called several witnesses, including members of his family, to testify on the rapper's behalf during the hearing, which began on Monday and was extended through Tuesday.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Lanez's father, Sonstar Peterson, issued an emotional appeal to the judge on his son's behalf, describing the trauma Lanez experienced after his mother died at a young age and how music became his outlet.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Raina Chassagne, the mother of Lanez's son, said that he is "the most supportive father" and asked the judge to be lenient to help end the generational curse of Black fathers in prison away from their children.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Another witness, Dr. Stephanie Herring, a clinical psychologist at a treatment facility, said that she believes Lanez suffers from PTSD, anxiety, substance abuse disorder and needs treatment.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Meanwhile, prosecutors on Monday read an impact statement from Pete, who called for Lanez to "be forced to face the full consequences of his heinous actions and face justice.”</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">“He not only shot me, he made a mockery of my trauma. He tried to position himself as a victim and set out to destroy my character and my soul. He lied to anyone that would listen and paid bloggers to disseminate false information about the case on social media. He released music videos and songs to damage my character and continue his crusade," Pete's statement said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">“Today, I beg this court to send a message to every victim of violence and fully hold the defendant accountable for his criminal conduct. This is a statement for all survivors that their lives matter and there is zero tolerance for the torture that accompanies violence," she added.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">ABC News has reached out to Pete's representatives for further comment following Lanez's sentencing.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Lanez, a Grammy-nominated rapper whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, was <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>convicted on Dec. 23, 2022</a> and faced up to 22 years and 8 months in prison.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The Los Angeles District Attorney's office, which is prosecuted this case, filed a motion in May asking the judge to give the rapper a 13-year sentence. Prosecutors also filed a motion on May 23, arguing for a harsher sentence. According to the motion, a new California law would by default make the rapper's sentence come in the "middle term" of the potential 22-year sentence, unless "circumstances in aggravation" were proven.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Prosecutors argued in the filing, obtained by ABC News, that "circumstances of aggravation" are present in this case and cited Lanez's "callousness."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Lanez's attorneys, Jose Baez and Matthew Barhoma, did not respond to ABC News' requests for comment.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Lanez was initially charged in October 2020 with one felony count each of assault with a semi-automatic firearm (personal use of a firearm) and carrying a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle, according to charging documents obtained by ABC News. "Personal use of a firearm" is not a separate charge, but is a sentencing enhancement linked to the first count. Lanez was also charged ahead of his trial with an additional felony count of discharging a firearm with gross negligence.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Lanez, who chose not to take the witness stand during the trial, pleaded not guilty to all three charges. His defense attorneys argued during the trial that Lanez was not the shooter.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Lanez was found guilty of three charges for shooting and injuring Megan in both of her feet in an incident in the Hollywood Hills on July 12, 2020.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The sentencing came after Superior Court of Los Angeles Judge David Herriford last month denied Lanez's request for a new trial.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">His previous attorney, George Mgdesyan, who represented him at trial, told ABC News then that Lanez was "disappointed" by the verdict. Asked on Dec. 23, 2022 whether he plans to appeal, Mgdesyan said that "everything is on the table."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">This case has<a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#> sparked intense debates</a> over society's treatment of women. Pete's account of the incident -- and the intense public vitriol she faced after sharing her story -- has <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>spotlighted the Protect Black Women movement</a>, which addresses the two-front battle of sexism and racism Black women experience in their own communities and in society at large.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Following the trial, Pete -- who testified during the trial and named Lanez as her shooter -- <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>broke her silence about the shooting</a> in an interview for her May 2023 Elle magazine cover story.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"I don't want to call myself a victim," she said. "As I reflect on the past three years, I view myself as a survivor, because I have truly survived the unimaginable. Not only did I survive being shot by someone I trusted and considered a close friend, but I overcame the public humiliation of having my name and reputation dragged through the mud by that individual for the entire world to see."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk eTIW sUzS">ABC News' Zohreen Shah and Vanessa Navarrete contributed to this report.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunChsmipmqigmr9uwM6rsGakkaOyu3nSnqtmq5Wjwaa6wp6bZquYpLy1tc2gZKKmmqq%2FqrrGZqSen5GjfLTAzquweKGUcn5xfo9wZ2xsZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-team-does-caris-levert-play-for.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What team does Caris LeVert Play for?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tim-scott-wife-who-is-south-carolina-senator-married.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tim Scott Wife: Who Is South Carolina Senator Married To?
