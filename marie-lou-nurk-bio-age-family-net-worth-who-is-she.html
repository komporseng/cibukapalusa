How different? Instead of sitting at her desk in the office and minding her own business, Marie now travels the world from event to event.

After that, Marie also gushed on a post that Jason’s “face” is “everything”.</p><p>Marie knew Selling Sunset existed, but she had never seen it before. After meeting Jason, she watched season 5 of the show. And now she is also part of Season 6. She has been really excited about it despite not having much time to prepare for it. Her participation in the production was planned quite spontaneously, she revealed recently.</p><p>In July 2022, Daily Mail spotted the couple cuddling up in Greece. The “model” accompanying America’s favorite realtor was later identified as Marie-Lou. Despite that, they had taken some time to confirm their relationship.</p><p>Marie, besides showing off her new man on social media, also has talked about her new attitude towards life since Jason. She spoke that she has a lot less privacy now.

So, in her words, art, interior design, and fashion have always played a very important role in her life. She might as well also pursue it as a career someday, especially under the influence of Jason. Marie did however also say that her dream is to one day run an atelier or interior design studio.</p><p>Per LinkedIn, Marie, for now, has been employed at Dash Design&nbsp;since October 2018</p><p>Formerly, she went to Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW), and after a three-year dual degree in business administration (2018 – 2021) there, she worked for a year as a strategist at the Strichpunkt Design agency.
