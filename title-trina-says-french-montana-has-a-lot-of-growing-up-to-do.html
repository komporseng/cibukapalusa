I never told him that I was your girl. There’s a lot of reasons. I guess now we can see why. Because you just got a lot of growing up to do. I could come up here and expose you and bash you, but I’m so much better than that. I’m not gonna do that. But I will say this, we were friends. And as being friends today as we speak makes two years I would have known you…I think a relationship to me starts with friendship. I think that me and him kinda was on the same page, but different pages kinda. He had a situation. He was going through a divorce or whatever. That was one of the reasons why I never really got into a relationship with him. I wanted that to be clear. And it was a lot of back and forth, but I was there with you every single day and step of the way while you was dealing and going through that. Beyond supportive. I’m the one that told you to step up to the plate like a man and make the right choice.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Trina then detailed the type of relationship she had with French. She says the Bronx, New York rapper always stayed at her house whenever he was in Miami, Florida and revealed that if it wasn’t for her, those outside of New York wouldn’t know who French Montana is.</p><p>“The friend that when you came to Miami you never slept in a hotel cause you stayed at my house every single time,” she said. “The friend that I have the keys to your house still right now today. That kind of friend. The friend that everything you post on your Instagram, your whole house, how it looks, I did that. The friend that sends and imports stuff, furniture, all kinds of stuff from Miami to New York. I did that. That kind of friend. So, let’s be clear on the friend thing since you want to be so messy about it. Because we were friends…First and foremost, nobody besides New York even paid you attention until me.”</p><p>The Miami rapper then spoke on her relationship with Lil Wayne, who she referred to as “a great person.” The two were engaged at one point, but ultimately broke off their engagement.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“Wayne is a great person,” Trina said. “He’s really a good [guy]. He’s a great guy as a man…When I was in a situation with Wayne so many years ago I think we were both just so young. I didn’t even think that we was in nothing. It just was like—We were friends and we just hung out and we was good. But it was like there’s a proposal. About to get married. It was just so much happening I was like ‘This can’t be real.’”</p><p>Trina’s interview with The Breakfast Club can be found below.</p><p><strong>RELATED:</strong><a href=#>Trina Talks Bonding With Nicki Minaj & Glass Ceiling For Females In Rap</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZjZoBxgY6toK2klWPBs7XNmmSsmamoeqe%2BxKeaoWWdpLu1rc2aZKGZo2KubrjOrWSonl2cv7DDyKeeZq2gYsGwecOo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brian-abell-obituary-louisville-ky-attorney-has-sadly-passed-away.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brian Abell Obituary, Louisville KY, Attorney Has Sadly Passed Away</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sid-haig-star-of-devils-reject-and-jackie-brown-dead-at-80.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sid Haig, cult film icon, dead at 80</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ha-young-choi.html>Ha Young Choi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./johnny-depp-clean-shaven-makeover-nyc-before-after-photos.html>Before &amp;amp; After Pics Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittany-renner-viral-video-scandal-telegram.html>Brittany Renner Viral Video Leaked Footage Scandal On Telegram 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-2.html>Patrick Mahomes Age, Net Worth, Wife, Family &amp;amp; Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suzanne-somers-74-dishes-she-and-husband-alan-hamel-84-have-been-having-a-lot-of-sex.html>Suzanne Somers, 74, dishes she and husband Alan Hamel, 84, have been 'having a lot of sex'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy.
