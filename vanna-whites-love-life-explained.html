Known for co-hosting the long-running game show,<i> Wheel of Fortune,</i> alongside her co-host, <strong>Pat Sajak,</strong> White has also tried her hands at various streams in the industry, including acting. &nbsp;</p><p>Born Vanna Marie White on February 18, 1957, in Horry County, South Carolina, White's venture into television game shows began after she contested on <i>The Price Is Right</i>. White has held the position of regular hostess on <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> since 1982 and sealed the deal to co-host the upcoming 2025-26 seasons as well. &nbsp;</p><h3>Inside Vanna White's Dating History! &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>Throughout her life in the spotlight, White has experienced her share of romances and heartbreaks. The television hostess is ever grateful to her <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> fans, whom she credits for helping her through a tough time. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/16/21569283_130430697592992_6956898205409738752_n%20(1)%20(1)-1697481170487.jpg><p>White was in the fourth year of her hosting stint on the game show when her fiancé, actor <strong>John Gibson,</strong> best known for starring in<i> Young and the Restless</i>, died in a plane crash in 1986." It was May 17, 1986. The second I heard about it, I fell to my knees. It was just devastating,"<a href=#> White recalled</a> years later before crediting her fans for giving her love and hope during the tragic time. &nbsp;</p><p>It took Vanna four years to cope with the loss and in 1990, she married her first husband, restaurateur <a href=#>George Santo Pietro</a>. Two years after her wedding, the <i>Totally Minnie </i>star announced her first pregnancy via a puzzle on the <i>Wheel of Fortune.</i> White had to endure another tragedy when she miscarried the baby shortly after. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/16/14718372_1743332155931984_6283052535708123136_n%20(1)%20(1)-1697481177510.jpg><p>Once again, Vanna turned to her fans' love and support to navigate the void. Like a rainbow at the end of a storm, Vanna's life also saw a positive turning when she welcomed her firstborn, <strong>Nikko Santo Pietro</strong>, in June 1994, and her daughter, <a href=#>Gigi</a>, in 1997. White's oldest, Nikko, 29, is a man of many talents. He is a professional chef, licensed real estate agent, and a television personality. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/16/13735884_935045873284132_851445644_n%20(1)%20(1)-1697481215764.jpg><p>White's daughter, Gigi, on the other hand, is a photographer, and a tattoo artist. Vanna's first marriage was a low-key and successful affair until it wasn't. The game show host and Pietro called it quits after 12 years in 2002 and continued to keep mum about their post-split relationship. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Following her divorce from George in late 2002, White was single for a while, but love knocked on her door again. She eventually started dating Southern California businessman <strong>Michael Kaye</strong> but kept the relationship under the radar. The pair got engaged in 2004 only to call it quits in 2006. &nbsp;</p><h3>Who is Vanna White Dating? &nbsp;</h3><p>One doesn't need to take a spin to guess Vanna's current relationship status. White is and has been in a stable relationship for a long time and the <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> star recently gave fans a much-needed update. The mother of two, 66, explained why she hasn't married her beau, contractor <strong>John Donaldson</strong>, her boyfriend of 12 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>White is set to co-host the upcoming 2025 and 26 seasons of 'Wheel of Fortune'</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>The game show hostess shares, "I mean, we've been together 12 years, and I feel like we are married," Vanna further adds, "Do we have to get married? No, because we feel comfortable in our relationship." The <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> star says she and Donaldson seldom discuss getting married. Giving fans the benefit of the doubt, White says "But you never know." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/16/13732134_308853772782564_2075123307_n%20(1)%20(1)-1697481208034.jpg><p>Vanna had been a divorcee for more than a decade when she came across Donaldson through a mutual friend in 2012. Calling John the "male version" of herself, <a href=#>Vanna said,</a> "He lets me be me, I let him be him. There is no drama." Although the pair are yet to bond in holy matrimony, they are practically a family, with Donaldson acting as the ultimate stepfather to Vanna's kids. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/16/15623719_666062816908518_2232391260201549824_n%20(1)%20(1)-1697481197921.jpg><p>Vanna's beau, Donaldson, is the owner of JDC Construction + Development Group, in California. He may be best known for long dating the<i> Wheel of Fortune</i> star, but John's circle consists of more celebs than one can imagine. Over the years, the California-based contractor and developer has worked with stars like <strong>Dan Akroyd, Richard Dreyfuss</strong>,&nbsp;and<strong> Martin Mull.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb </a>for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jq%2BYp6aRYsSptdOeqmakn6uybrjIn5xmnailuaK1zZ6b</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./william-quigley.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>William Quigley</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./johnny-dang-net-worth-how-the-king-of-bling-built-his-jewelry-empire.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Johnny Dang Net Worth: How the King of Bling Built His Jewelry Empire</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ha-young-choi.html>Ha Young Choi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./johnny-depp-clean-shaven-makeover-nyc-before-after-photos.html>Before &amp;amp; After Pics Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittany-renner-viral-video-scandal-telegram.html>Brittany Renner Viral Video Leaked Footage Scandal On Telegram 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-2.html>Patrick Mahomes Age, Net Worth, Wife, Family &amp;amp; Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suzanne-somers-74-dishes-she-and-husband-alan-hamel-84-have-been-having-a-lot-of-sex.html>Suzanne Somers, 74, dishes she and husband Alan Hamel, 84, have been 'having a lot of sex'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy.
