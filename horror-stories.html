The so-called&nbsp;Bête du Gévaudan, or Beast of Gévaudan, attacked hundreds of people, often tearing out their throats. No one knew what it was — or how to stop it.</a><p>The first victim was a 14-year-old shepherdess named Jeanne Boulet, who in 1764 was discovered with her throat ripped out. A 15-year-old was found dead a month later. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She managed to describe her attacker as “a horrible beast”</a> before succumbing to her wounds.</p><p>More than 100 people had their chests or throats ripped out, as news of the beast made international headlines.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-245834 alt="Horror Stories" width=1200 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/horror-stories-featured.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-245834 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The French spent three years hunting the bloodthirsty beast.</span></p><p>The corpses showed clear signs that something with sharp claws and teeth was responsible, while the press described a wolf-like animal with russet and black fur, a wide chest, large mouth, and very sharp teeth.</p><p>It didn’t take long for infantry leader Jean Baptiste Duhamel to organize a 30,000-volunteer hunting party to find and kill the beast. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Smithsonian</a>, they offered a reward equivalent to a year’s salary for ending the ghoulish creature’s life.</p><p>When that didn’t work, King Louis XV sent his own bodyguard, François Antoine, down south to get the job done.</p><p>In September 1765, Antoine and his team finally killed a large wolf. They returned to Versailles and received their reward from Louis XV, and the attacks on Gévaudan ceased entirely — but only for a couple of months.</p><p>With every subsequent attack, the animal’s description became more fantastical. Some accounts described it as a supernatural being that walked on its hind legs. Others said it was more like a werewolf — part-wolf, part-man.</p>The trailer for Brotherhood of the Wolf, which is based on this 18th-century horror story.<p>Fed up with losing his loved ones amid a near-constant state of terror, one local farmer took matters into his own hands.</p><p>As this real-life horror story goes, Jean Chastel wandered into the mountains, armed with a gun and a few silver bullets. He sat down and read the Bible, hoping that making himself an easy target would lure the beast from its lair.</p><p>It worked. Soon enough, the beast appeared, Chastel shot it, and he brought it to the king. Some accounts claimed the wolf’s stomach was opened up and had human remains tumbling out.</p><p>Historians have long debated what actually occurred at Gévaudan. Some argue it was merely mass hysteria and a pack of wild wolves that did the killing, while others claimed it was a lone, rabid wolf or an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">escaped lion</a>.</p><p>Nonetheless, this horror story inspired Robert Louis Stevenson’s 1879 book Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes and modern productions like Christophe Gans’ 2002 horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonypu9Grpqtlo6m8s7XErGZs</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hailey-williams.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hailey Williams - Bio, Age, In Relation, Nationality, Net Worth, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-nevers-episode-2-ending-explained-whos-the-real-villain.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Nevers Episode 2 Ending Explained: Whos the Real Villain?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ha-young-choi.html>Ha Young Choi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./johnny-depp-clean-shaven-makeover-nyc-before-after-photos.html>Before &amp;amp; After Pics Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittany-renner-viral-video-scandal-telegram.html>Brittany Renner Viral Video Leaked Footage Scandal On Telegram 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-2.html>Patrick Mahomes Age, Net Worth, Wife, Family &amp;amp; Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suzanne-somers-74-dishes-she-and-husband-alan-hamel-84-have-been-having-a-lot-of-sex.html>Suzanne Somers, 74, dishes she and husband Alan Hamel, 84, have been 'having a lot of sex'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy.
