So far, the series has taken us through Dwayne's life as he was growing up. From his family life to his dating life, we've seen the hilarity unfold for five episodes now.</p><p>This week's episode titled 'A Day with Andre' brings on a new character played by 'The Mandalorian' actress Rosario Dawson. The synopsis of the new episode reads: "Hawaii, 1982: Dewey spends a day with Andre the Giant that neither will ever forget; Lia and Rocky prepare for the huge Island Battle Royale, where more than the title is at stake; in 2032, candidate Johnson reveals his running mate."</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong><br><a href=# rel>EXCLUSIVE | 'Young Rock' actress Lexie Duncan says Margot Robbie was her inspiration and dishes on how she prepared for Karen’s 'many layers'</a><br><a href=# rel>Who was Fanene Leifi Pita Maivia? Dwayne Johnson's late wrestler grandfather was known as the flying Hawaiian</a></p><h2 class=split>Whose character does Rosario Dawson play?</h2><p>Dawson will play General Monica Jackson <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">described</a> to be "a resilient leader, confident and steadfast in her decisions. Representative of her decorated years of service, General Jackson is an unrivaled force whose respected ethics and values are introduced as a very integral key to Dwayne Johnson's presidential campaign". It would seem that Jackson would be Johnson's running mate, but does it prove to be a good choice? Johnson might have to answer some questions.</p><p>Without too many spoilers, this week's new episode is one of the good one as we get more than one storyline. We're also excited to see Matthew Willig in the role of André the Giant and the Hawaii episodes seemingly are the best ones. While some have expressed that the sitcom doesn't mark a hit in the comedy genre, the series has grown on many since its initial debut. The jokes, well, are hilarious, if you don't take it too seriously.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/94a772fc-f2d1-4a70-8069-dc1a6f5dfe38.JPG><p>Dawson, who plays the role of Ahsoka Tano in 'The Mandalorian' and previously stole hearts as Jane Ramos in 'Jane The Virgin', will be a great addition to the cast. So far we've seen seen 'Fresh Off the Boat' actor Randall Park interact with future Johnson in the series, as the star takes us back to his childhood days. The actress makes her appearance in the opening minutes of the episode, and looks great in uniform as well.</p><p>&nbsp;A new episode 7 'Johnson & Hopkins' will air on Tuesday, April 6, at 8 pm EST on NBC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRosZ%2Bqu6h50aiapGWjmq60u81maGadoJ7AsLDEZm1mnJGueqK6w6ucZqqfqK6ztc5mm5qvo6S7brPEp5yrmZxiurC6yJyYZqKRmLi0u81mqa6mnp67qHnMmqueZWJlgHM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jack-o-connell.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jack OConnell Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-kemal-rideout-nyc-subway-slasher-held-without-bail.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Kemal Rideout?
