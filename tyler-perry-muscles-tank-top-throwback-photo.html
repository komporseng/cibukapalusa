Taking to his Instagram on Dec. 28, Tyler shared a photo of himself with the caption, “<span>I took this picture this past September around my 52nd birthday. I was killing it in the gym. Right after that I tore my meniscus and was told I needed surgery. I’ve gained about 12 lbs since then. I was so close to my goal, but now I feel like I’m starting over.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5><span>“All of that to say, sometimes life will set you back, but as long as you have a breath in your body, you have to keep fighting,” he continued. “I’ll get it back when I recover. Happy New Year! Let’s get after it in 2022. Who’s with me? #willsmiththebestshapeofmylife” In the selfie, Tyler shows of his bulging biceps and toned stomach in a tight black tank top, which got quite a response from his famous followers. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mario Lopez</strong> </a>wrote, “</span><span>Lookin good my man!” in the comments section, while <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tamar Braxton</strong></a> said, “Winners recover.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Tyler-Perry-Throwback-Pic-Gained-12lbs-SN-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>The Madea star is no stranger to keeping his health on track after he first focused on losing weight when he was cast as the titular homicide detective in 2012’s Alex Cross, based on the best-selling&nbsp;<strong>James Patterson</strong> novels. He revealed he lost 30 pounds ahead of filming, telling <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Men’s Health </a>it was a life-changing experience. “I walk into a room with a lot more confidence. All my life I’ve tried to hide my height. I was taller than everybody else and stood out, so I would slouch and try to hide it,” Tyler explained. “But with what I’ve been able to do with my body, I’m owning it. I’m standing up when I walk into a room.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze5FyZq2xnJq%2FbrzEq6myZZ2qwKS4xKxkrZmeoHq1u89mq6Gqn6yvoq%2FKZqehp6SkfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gary-sheffields-wealth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gary Sheffield's Wealth - NewsNow Nigeria</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jade-helm.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Truth Behind The Hysteria</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ha-young-choi.html>Ha Young Choi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./johnny-depp-clean-shaven-makeover-nyc-before-after-photos.html>Before &amp;amp; After Pics Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittany-renner-viral-video-scandal-telegram.html>Brittany Renner Viral Video Leaked Footage Scandal On Telegram 2023</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./patrick-mahomes-2.html>Patrick Mahomes Age, Net Worth, Wife, Family &amp;amp; Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suzanne-somers-74-dishes-she-and-husband-alan-hamel-84-have-been-having-a-lot-of-sex.html>Suzanne Somers, 74, dishes she and husband Alan Hamel, 84, have been 'having a lot of sex'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy.
