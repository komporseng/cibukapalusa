While introducing herself to the reality show people, Lara described that she is very handy and good at fixing things. When she was asked “What do you do in your off time on the boat?” by them she answered that she works out, does courses to improve her deckhand skills, and loves to socialize. <span>She opened up that her favorite place to be been on charter/place you are Bonifacio, France, and Bali.</span></p><p>As to her first impression of Mustique, she said “she” was very dirty and desperately needed a cleaning.</p><p>Referring to Below Deck Med particularly or just her profession in general, Lara also happens to have mentioned that — “the people you work with become your family, and you make love-hate relationships.”</p><p>When Lara was finally allowed to speak of her participation in the show, she took to her social media a glimpse of herself on the boat and teased “Bet y’all expected this one 😝Things are about to get rough in the Med 😮‍💨.” Since then, she has been inviting people to see her on TV.</p><p>Just before Bravo happened to her, she was seemingly a cocktail girl. Because a friend or rather a colleague of hers recently took to IG to wish her luck for Below Deck, she called Lara their “cocktail girl at Ex Mock Turtle.”</p><p>Other newcomers joining Lara on this season of Below Deck were chef Jack Luby, stew Jessika Asai, bosun Ruan Irving, and deckhands Haleigh Gorman and Lara Du Preez.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Lara Du Preez Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Lara Du Preez reportedly had almost $200K net worth by September 2023.</p><p>If you also need to know about her salary from Below Deck, deckhands like her are paid for their hard work as the role is considered one of the most essential among the crew members.

She shared that she had been wanting to go into this career path for a very long time. Getting there, she said was a “very rough road”. And at times, she said it felt like it was never going to happen. So, what Lara basically wanted to say was it was a “hectic” couple of years with ups and downs that taught her a big lesson in life.</p><h3><strong>Is Lara Du Preez Dating Anyone?</strong></h3><p>Unlike fellow cast member Ruan Irving, Lara was likely not dating anyone as of September 2023.
