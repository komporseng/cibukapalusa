What is his job? Where is he now? Is he still in a relationship with Chase?</p><p>Read all about him here in this article.</p><h3><strong>My Strange Addiction: Where Is Car Guy Nathaniel Now?</strong></h3><p>TLC’s My Strange Addiction is back for another season in 2023 and a few of the cast members are returning to the show including car guy Nathaniel who is reportedly in a serious relationship with his car. The TLC program debuted in 2010. My Strange Addiction: Still Addicted? is available and airs every Wednesday at 10/9c.</p><p>TLC must show fans where the show’s stars are now because they are too fascinating to keep a secret.</p><p>Nathaniel appeared in season three of the TLC show more than ten years ago. His episode, which was broadcast in February 2012, revealed to fans how near he was to his car. Nathaniel was 27 years old and a resident of Royal, Arkansas at the time his episode aired. He said that he had a long-term love for his car 1998 Chevy Monte Carlo, which he had given the moniker “Chase.”</p><p>According to the show, Nathaniel “met Chase at a resale lot” five years earlier. Nathaniel still has a relationship with his car, but it’s not the one he had ten years ago, as the new season reveals. He’s now dating a black automobile by the name of “Lex.”</p><p>When Nathaniel and Chase are reunited with TLC viewers, they might be shocked to learn that they are no longer dating. The car is “no longer a part of his life,” the 39-year-old said, adding that it “breaks his heart” that Chase “isn’t here.” The man was moved to tears during the program. Nathaniel keeps the souvenirs from his car in a bedroom.</p><p>A canvas print of himself and his car is among the goods, as is a blanket covered with his favorite pictures. According to the program, the vehicle was “involved in a serious accident during a routine check-up.” In his own words, Nathaniel “felt Chase deserved better.”</p><p>Nathaniel’s addiction is called Objectophillia. Nathaniel was obsessed with cars since he was a teenager and used to build model cars, but never took it too seriously. He even dated a few women but, when he first saw Chase at a car dealership. However Nathaniel’s love for Chase extends beyond just songs and dates, he confessed that he has se*ual relationships with Chase.</p><p>“It was love at first sight. His body and his interior and everything just together seemed to fit. I felt an instant connection. I don’t know why I feel the way I do, but I just know I absolutely love Chase. We always have a good time together,” Nathaniel said.</p><p>Nathaniel met Chase in 2005 at a resale vehicle store and fell in love instantly. Talking about his carnal relationship with the car, Nathaniel said, “We have our times where things get sexual. What we do most often is, I like to lean over his fender and across his hood and do little things like that and kind of press up against him and rub against him like that.” He also added, that one of his bold positions of achieving sexual gratification is when Nathaniel is underneath Chase. He told TLC that Chase likes that position. For him “making love” to Chase is really special.</p><h3><strong>Car Guy Nathaniel Age</strong></h3><p>In 2023, Cary Guy Nathaniel is 39 years of age.</p><h3><strong>What Is Car Guy Nathaniel Last Name?</strong></h3><p>The last name of Car Guy Nathaniel is not available at this moment.</p><h3><strong>Car Guy Nathaniel Job</strong></h3><p>Car Guy Nathaniel worked as a customer service technician for a job.
