Source: Instagram</p><h2><span id=Educational_Institutions_and_Football>Educational Institutions and Football</span></h2><p>From a young age, Cam was a talented sportsman. He played baseball and basketball as a youth. However, later on, Cam developed a fear of being hit by a pitch in baseball. Likewise, Cam also couldn’t avoid foul trouble on the basketball court. Therefore, he stopped playing baseball at 14 years old and also quit basketball shortly after attending high school. In the year 2015, Cam Newton graduated from Auburn University. He graduated with a degree in sociology.</p><p>Previously, Cam attended Westlake High School in Atlanta. There, Cam played for the high school’s football team.

He plays for the NFL’s New England Patriots. Before joining this team, Cam played nine seasons with the Carolina Panthers. His previous team, i.e. Carolina Panthers, selected Cam first overall in the 2011 NFL Draft.</p><p>Moreover, Cam had college football stints at Florida and Blinn. This was before joining Auburn. Auburn is where Cam won the Bowl Champion Series National Championship and Heisman Trophy in the year 2010. Newton is nicknamed “Super Cam” and the quarterback is the NFL career leader in quarterback rushing touchdowns at 70.</p><p>Likewise, Cam made an impact in his first season. During this season, Cam set the rookie records for passing and rushing yards by a quarterback. Eventually, Cam won the NFL Offensive, Rookie of the Year award, in the process. Moreover, Cam became the league’s first rookie quarterback to throw for 4,000 yards in a season. Similarly, Cam also was the first to throw for 400 yards in his NFL debut.</p><h4>More Details</h4><p>Similarly, the quarterback also set the season record for quarterback rushing touchdowns at the age of 14. Between the years 2013 and 2017, Cam led the Panthers to three division titles as well as four playoff appearances. The quarterback’s most successful season came in the year 2015. This was back when they named Cam “Most Valuable Player” (MVP). At the same time, Cam also helped the Carolina Panthers obtain a franchise-best 15–1 record en route to a Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl 50.</p><p>Furthermore, Cam is also one of four African-American quarterbacks to win NFL MVP. He was also the first African-American quarterback to solely receive this award/title.&nbsp;Following his MVP campaign, the Atlanta-born quarterback struggled with injuries. His then-team, the Panthers made the playoffs only once in their subsequent four seasons.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-110482 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cam-Newton-captured-in-a-photograph-while-playing-for-the-Patriots.jpg alt="Cam Newton" width=650 height=433 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-110482 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Cam was captured in a photograph while playing for the Patriots. Source: The Providence Journal</p><p>Cam missed the majority of the 2019 season due to surgery. Eventually, the Carolina Panthers released him following his missed season. Cam later signed with the Patriots. The quarterback succeeded the departing Tom Brady. Tom was the team’s previous quarterback. Cam succeeded Tom and became the Patriots’ starting quarterback for the year 2020. This made Cam the first Patriots’ first-string quarterback since Drew Bledsoe in the year 2001, except Tom Brady.</p><h4>Business ventures</h4><p>In the year 2013, Newton partnered with Southern department store chain “Belk”. This was on his clothing line called MADE by Newton. Further, in May 2019, the quarterback’s cigar bar and restaurant named “Fellowship” formally opened at Olympic Park Drive Dr. This is located near Mercedes-Benz Stadium in downtown Atlanta.</p><p>Along with his commitment to football, Cam also participates in motivational speaking. The quarterback also has a foundation by his name that is dedicated to “enhancing the lives of youth by addressing their educational, physical, and social needs”.</p><h4>Diet and Lifestyle</h4><p>Newton was a self-proclaimed pescetarian. He turned vegan in March 2019. Following this change in his diet, a few dietitians claimed that this may have delayed Cam’s injury recovery the following season. Moreover, Cam is a Christian and was seen speaking about his faith after winning the 2011 BCS National Championship Game. He said:</p><p>“It’s just a God thing. I thank God every single day. I’m just His instrument and He’s using me on a consistent basis daily.”</p><p>Cam met with a car crash on December 9, 2014. This was in Charlotte where Cam’s vehicle flipped and he consequently suffered two back fractures. Moreover, the quarterback’s daily routine during the game season involves waking up at 4:20 a.m., leaving the house at 4:30 a.m., and finally sleeping at 11:30 p.m.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><p>Newton was in a romantic relationship with Kia Proctor for a long time. The duo shares four biological children. They welcomed their first child, son Chosen Sebastian Newton, in December 2015.

Further, in the fall of 2019, Cam and Kia welcomed their fourth child, Cashmere Saint Newton.</p><p>However, just before this, Cam fathered a child in mid-2019 with an Instagram model and his son’s name is Caesar Lorenzo Newton. This was only months before Cam welcomed his 4th biological kid with Kia. Eventually, Cam and Proctor went their separate ways the same year, i.e. 2019. All in all, Newton has five biological children while writing this biography. As of now, he seems to be <strong>single.</strong></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-110489 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cam-Newton-posing-for-a-photo-with-his-children-from-left-to-right-Chosen-Sovereign-Dior-Camidas-Cashmere-and-Caesar.jpg alt="Cam Newton" width=650 height=244 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-110489 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Newton posing for a photo with his children, from left to right – Chosen, Sovereign-Dior, Cameras, Cashmere, and Caesar.
